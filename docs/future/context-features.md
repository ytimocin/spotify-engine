# Future Enhancement: Context Features

## Overview

Contextual information can significantly improve recommendation relevance by understanding when and how users listen.

## Potential Context Features

### 1. Temporal Context

- Time of day
- Day of week
- Season/weather correlation
- Holiday patterns

### 2. Device Context

- Mobile vs Desktop
- Headphones vs Speakers
- Car vs Home listening

### 3. Activity Context

- Workout playlists
- Study/focus sessions
- Party/social settings
- Commute patterns

## Implementation Ideas

### Data Generation

```python
context_types = ['workout', 'study', 'party', 'commute', 'relax']
session_context = random.choices(context_types, weights=[0.1, 0.2, 0.1, 0.3, 0.3])
```

### Model Integration

- Add context embeddings
- Context-aware attention mechanisms
- Multi-task learning objectives

## Benefits

1. **Situational Awareness**: Different recommendations for gym vs study
2. **Better Timing**: Right music at the right time
3. **User Understanding**: Learn listening habits

## Challenges

- Data sparsity for rare contexts
- Privacy considerations
- Increased model complexity
