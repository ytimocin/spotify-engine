- Mood detection and adaptation

#### Advanced Evaluation & Metrics
Comprehensive evaluation beyond accuracy:
- Diversity metrics (intra-list diversity, genre/artist diversity)
- Coverage metrics (catalog coverage, long-tail coverage)
- Fairness metrics (genre bias, popularity bias, demographic fairness)
- Temporal evaluation (performance degradation over time)
- A/B testing framework for recommendation variants
- User satisfaction and engagement metrics
