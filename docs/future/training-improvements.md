# Future Training Improvements

## 1. Train/Validation/Test Splits

Currently all data is used for training. Production system should:
- 70% train, 15% validation, 15% test
- Time-based splits (train on past, test on future)
- User-based splits (cold-start evaluation)

## 2. Advanced Loss Functions

Beyond BPR:
- **Weighted loss**: Weight by listening time/completion
- **Multi-task learning**: Predict both clicks and completion
- **Contrastive learning**: Learn from session context

## 3. Model Versioning

Track experiments properly:
```python
models/
├── v1_2024-01-15_bpr/
│   ├── model.ckpt
│   ├── config.json
│   └── metrics.json
├── v2_2024-01-16_weighted/
│   └── ...
```

## 4. Hyperparameter Tuning

Current fixed values that could be tuned:
- Learning rate (currently 0.01)
- Embedding dimension (currently 32)
- Number of attention heads (currently 4)
- Batch size (currently 512)
- Negative sampling ratio

## 5. Better Evaluation

- **NDCG**: Considers ranking position
- **Coverage**: How many songs get recommended
- **Diversity**: Variety in recommendations
- **A/B testing**: Real user feedback

## 6. Training Optimizations

- **Early stopping**: Stop when validation metric plateaus
- **Learning rate scheduling**: Reduce LR over time
- **Gradient clipping**: Prevent training instability
- **Mixed precision training**: Faster on modern GPUs

## 7. Cold Start Handling

- Use artist embeddings for new songs
- Content-based features for new users
- Popularity-based fallbacks
